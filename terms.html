  <h1>Whiteout Networks Terms of Use (&quot;ToU&quot;)</h1>
  <p>Last modified: 15. May 2014</p>

  <h2>1. You May License These Services From Us</h2>
  <p>The application and associated services "Whiteout Mail" (the "Services") are provided to you by Whiteout Networks GmbH ("Whiteout" or "We") directly or indirectly via various App stores (the "Platform"). We are your contractual partner and the only partner entitled to grant you the rights to use the Services, subject to your acceptance of these ToU. Neither the operator of the Platform nor any of its subsidiaries may be your contractual partner regarding the Services.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge that you may only use the Services in accordance with these terms. By using the Services you further acknowledge and agree that you have read, that you understand and agree with the ToU. </p>

  <h2>2. The Rights We Give You </h2>
  <p>Upon your acceptance of the ToU we grant the non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable, irrevocable right to you to use the Services in object code form for your own private purposes. </p>
  <p>We are free to publish the source code of our Services in the Internet or deliver the source code along with the object code. If we do so, we do that for the sole purpose of giving you the opportunity to inspect the source code. We do not allow you to do anything else but inspecting the source code, e.g. modifying, translating or distributing the source code of the Services. Rights that you may have according to mandatory law remain however unaffected. </p>
  <p>Open-source software is important to us. Therefore our Services are implemented and delivered along alongside separate Open-Source-software modules ("OSS") that interact with our Services. For such OSS, the respective license terms applicable shall prevail over the above provisions of sec. 2. Upon your request, we will provide you with the source code of the OSS and the license terms applicable, if the respective license terms provide so. </p>
  <p>The specific license terms can be found here: https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5.</p>

  <h2>3. Using Our Services </h2>
  <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any username and password or passphrase that you may provide.</p>
  <p>We may create improvements of the Services, e.g. by way of updates, upgrades, new versions or bug fixes etc. ("Improvements"). Depending on the platform capabilities, you may or may not be receiving these updates automatically. If not we highly recommend that you install all updates. We are not obliged to create and publish Improvements of the service. We cannot promise to inform you about any Improvements we may make available from time to time.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Obligations </h2>
  <p>Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not try to reverse engineer, disassemble or translate the Services or access the Services using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may not modify or lease the Services, nor may you attempt to extract the source code from the object code of the Services, unless mandatory law allows you to do so or you have our written permission. We may decide to provide you with the source code of the Services anyway, in order to give you the opportunity to inspect it (cf. sec. 2). </p>
  <p>You may use our Services only in accordance with the provisions of this TOU and as permitted by law, including applicable export and control laws and regulations. Do not use the Services in a way that has a negative impact on the Services itself, associated websites or on software that the Services accesses. You must also not use the Services to conduct criminal acts or preparations of such. </p>

  <h2>5. Our Warranties </h2>
  <p>The function and the purpose of the Services are described on our homepage www.whiteout.io. We do not make any specific promises beyond the aforesaid description. For example, we cannot make any further commitments regarding the specific functions of the Services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. </p>
  <p>The purpose of the Services is to encrypt your E-Mails in order to protect your privacy. However, we do not make any promises pertaining to the reliability, efficiency and/or security of the encryption that is provided by the Services. </p>
  <p>Our liability with respect to defects in material or defects in title is limited to our fraudulent concealment of such defects (Sec. 523, 524 of the German civil code (BGB)). </p>

  <h2>6. Our Liability</h2>
  <p>Our liability in case of defects is exclusively governed by sec. 5. Otherwise, our liability is limited to intent and gross negligence (Sec. 521 BGB). </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding any to the contrary in this ToU, we bear unlimited liability for personal injury to life, body or health, under the terms of the Product Liability Act and to the extent of any written guarantee given by us. </p>

  <h2>7. Data Privacy</h2>
  <p>Please find our Data Privacy Policy for the Services on www.[...] in the section <a href="/privacy.html">Data Privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Final Provisions</h2>
  <p>This ToU and any claim, right, or obligation pertaining to it shall be governed by the laws of Germany without regards to its conflicts of law provisions. The UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall be excluded. </p>
  <p>In case a provision of the TOU should be invalid or unenforceable or in case of a gap in the TOU, the other provisions of the TOU remain unaffected. In such case however, both of us shall be obliged to agree to the replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision or to an amendment of this TOU for the missing provision. If and insofar there is a gap in the provisions of the TOU, the provisions to fill this gap shall come closest to what both of us would have agreed to, if the gap had been known from the beginning.</p>
  <p>Changes of and amendments to the TOU shall only be effective if made in writing. This shall also apply to any amendment of this provision itself.</p>
